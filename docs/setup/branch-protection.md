# Branch Protection Setup

GitHub branch protection rules must be configured manually in the repository settings. These cannot be set via files in the repository.

## How to Configure

Go to: **Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule**

Configure the following for the `main` branch:

### Required Settings

| Setting                                                              | Value                   | Why                                               |

| **Require a pull request before merging**                            | On                      | Prevents direct pushes                            |

| **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed** | On                      | Re-reviews if PR changes                          |
| **Require review from Code Owners**                                  | On                      | Domain-specific PRs need domain team approval     |
| **Require status checks to pass before merging**                     | On                      | CI must pass                                      |
| **Required status checks**                                           | `lint`, `test`, `build` | Match the job names in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| **Require branches to be up to date before merging**                 | On                      | Must rebase on latest main                        |
| **Require conversation resolution before merging**                   | On                      | All review comments must be resolved              |
| **Require linear history**                                           | On                      | Squash or rebase only - no merge commits          |
| **Do not allow force pushes**                                        | On                      | Protects commit history                           |

### Optional Additional Branch Rules

For release branches or protected tags:

| Pattern     | Setting               | Purpose                  |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `release/*` | Require 1 review + CI | Protect release branches |
| `v*` tags   | Require 1 review      | Protect version tags     |

---

### How to Set via GitHub CLI

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["lint","test","build"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_code_owner_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

---

### Verification

After setup, verify by attempting a direct push to main:

```bash
git checkout main
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt && git commit -m "test: direct push attempt"
git push origin main
```

This should be **blocked** with a message like:

```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed.
remote: error: Required status check "lint" has not succeeded.
```

Clean up:

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
rm test.txt
```
