# HR-BE-002 - Close-out

HR + Payroll backend API and business rules: leave ledger, payroll runs, state
machines, RLS isolation, audit + events, and the concurrency hardening that
turned out to be necessary. This document records what was delivered, item by
item, with source/test citations, and the exact verification evidence for the
final gate.

Verification status: **all items closed, all gates green** as of
`e267d3d` (see [Verification gate](#verification-gate)), and re-verified
after the `nkswalih/dev` merge (see
[Post-merge gate - dev merge](#post-merge-gate--dev-merge)).

### Item 2 - repository-level entry immutability (four cases)

Canonical four scenarios, all green at the repository layer (direct repo calls,
bypassing the service):

| Case                               | Test                                                                     | Guard                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UPDATE blocked on **approved** run | `test_direct_update_blocked_on_approved_run` (`test_payroll_api.py:372`) | atomic WHERE-guard in `update_entry` (`payroll/repository.py`) |
| UPDATE blocked on **paid** run     | `test_direct_update_blocked_on_paid_run` (`test_payroll_api.py:391`)     | same guard                                                     |
| UPDATE blocked on **voided** run   | `test_direct_update_blocked_on_voided_run` (`test_payroll_api.py:412`)   | same guard                                                     |
| UPDATE allowed on **computed** run | `test_direct_update_allowed_on_computed_run` (`test_payroll_api.py:431`) | same guard, mutable statuses allowed                           |

Classification (verified with `git log -p`): a select-then-raise backstop
predated these tests (`65249aa`), and the tests (`9545006`) formalized that
coverage. The backstop was then hardened from select-then-raise to an **atomic**
conditional-UPDATE guard (`9cb80d5`) - a real correctness improvement beyond a
pure test gap. Net: **0 code defects** in the four cases; 1 hardening commit
and 4 tests.

Out-of-scope finding from this exercise: the DELETE path had **no** immutability
guard at all - `delete_entries_for_run` would happily drop entries from an
approved/paid/voided run. That was a real correctness gap and is closed by
`9071545` + the two delete tests (`test_payroll_api.py:446`, `:467`).

## The stale-balance race - unplanned discovery

Discovered, not designed, and **outside** the 14-item list: two concurrent
approvals on different requests for the same employee could both read the same
pre-approval balance, both pass the negative-balance check, and both write a
materialized `erp_leave_balances` row from their own transaction's view - the
ledger went negative while the materialized balance read `>= 0`, invisible to
`ck_erp_leave_balances_non_negative`.

**Lifecycle**

1. **Discovered** during concurrency hardening review (item 9) - initial
   reproduction: `test_concurrent_approve_cross_requests_invariant`, shipped
   `xfail` (`79e43b7`).
2. **Tracked** in this doc's predecessor, §4.3 item 5 of
   `docs/modules/hr-payroll.md`, as a known, unresolved, tracked defect - not an
   accepted tradeoff.
3. **Fixed** - row-level locking, see below.
4. **Closed** - §4.3 rewritten to RESOLVED (`e267d3d`); the `xfail` is a
   deterministic pass; stress/deadlock/first-grant regressions added.

**Fix mechanism.** Every balance-mutating path takes a row lock on
`erp_leave_balances (tenant_id, employee_id, leave_type)` before reading or
rechecking the balance:

- `HrRepository.lock_leave_balance` (`hr/repository.py:502`) **seeds** the row
  (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on `uq_erp_leave_balances_employee_type`,
  balance 0) then `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`. Seeding is required: FOR UPDATE on a
  missing row locks nothing, and the row would otherwise only be created by
  `upsert_balance`.
- After the lock, the service **re-probes with a fresh recompute** - never the
  pre-lock value - so the `>= 0` check runs against the serialized state
  (`hr/repository.py:518`, re-probe used by approve/accrual).
- `approve_leave_request` locks before its §4.2 check (`hr/service.py:521`);
  cancellation of an approved request locks before the reversal
  (`hr/service.py:663`); the accrual path locks in `accrue_leave_movement`
  (`hr/repository.py:518`).
- **Deadlock ordering.** Multi-row callers acquire locks in a stable
  deterministic order. `compute_run`'s accrual loop iterates
  `list_active_employees`, which sorts by `employee_number`
  (`payroll/repository.py:647`). The LOCK-ORDERING CONTRACT is documented at the
  call site (`payroll/service.py:308`) and on `lock_leave_balance`
  (`hr/repository.py:518`). No code change was needed for ordering - the roster
  query was already deterministic; the contract is now load-bearing and
  documented.

**Regression coverage** (`tests/integration/api/test_concurrency_atomicity.py`):

- `test_concurrent_approve_cross_requests_invariant` - passes deterministically,
  no longer `xfail`.
- `test_concurrent_approve_cross_requests_stress_balance_exact` - 10 concurrent
  approvals; materialized balance == ledger == 0, movements == approvals.
- `test_concurrent_compute_with_approval_no_deadlock` - compute racing an
  approval; run computed, grants + approval movement settle, materialized ==
  ledger.
- `test_concurrent_first_grant_single_movement` - two concurrent first-grant
  accruals produce exactly one grant movement; proves the post-lock re-probe.

Related anomalies logged (not fixed here, out of scope): migration 0009's
`erp_leave_movements_guard_negative` trigger applies to **all** leave types, so
a _serial_ negative non-accrual approval already 500s at INSERT while the
service allows it by design - a pre-existing inconsistency to be reconciled in a
follow-up.

## Post-merge gate - dev merge

`nkswalih/dev` merged as `af2dd4d` (parents `e09550a9c` + `f7e1f666b`).
The 14 items and the race fix were re-verified against the merged tree, then
the full gate was re-run and all new findings fixed in follow-up `d2c941c`.
All numbers below are the post-merge, post-fix results.

**Dev-merge conflicts resolved** (add/add on shared modules):
`alembic/versions/0010_erp_sequences_and_audit_log.py` (renumbered from 0006),
`0011_leave_approval_status_and_adjusted_entries.py` (from 0007),
`0012_leave_balances_from_movements.py` (from 0008),
`0013_leave_ledger_triggers.py` (from 0009), and identity `0017` (from 0015);
`tests/unit/core/test_audit_events.py` (kept dev's inventory catalog test).

**Gate fixes shipped in `d2c941c`:**

- identity `test_mfa.py` - `/api/v1/invitations/accept` is now multipart/form-data;
  test switched from `json=` to `data=` (dev added the avatar `UploadFile` field).
- mypy strict typing: `domain/entities.py`, `models/core_audit_log.py`,
  `alembic/versions/0010_...py`, `api/v1/schemas/payroll.py`
  (`SkippedEmployeeOut` explicit construction), `features/payroll/repository.py`
  (`CursorResult` guard), `features/hr/ports.py` (`approved_unpaid_days`).
- ruff format/import hygiene on the three merge-touched test files.
- No source-level behavioral change; core suite passes unchanged on a fresh DB.

**Test-isolation note.** The core API suite shares permanent tenants
`olympus`/`globex`/`disabledco`, created on demand and cleaned up per test by
the `integration_db` fixture - but only when the fixture itself created them.
After the dev merge these tenant rows persisted in the identity-owned
`tenants` table (core's `downgrade base` does not drop identity data), so
employee counters and payroll runs leaked between tests (19 failures, e.g.
`test_employee_numbers_are_sequential_per_tenant`, PR-1 period-conflict 409s).
Fix: delete the persistent test-tenant rows before the gate run so the fixture
recreates them per test. The full suite then passes (441/441).

## Commit range

`git log --oneline 0f2021e..HEAD` = **32 commits** = 28 implementation commits
plus 4 close-out meta-commits. **The counts in this section are accurate as of
the reconciliation commit (this one).** Because this document lists its own
history, it can never include the commits that create and correct it - any
future edit to this file is a fifth meta-commit that moves the live count
again, so re-run `git log --oneline 0f2021e..HEAD` rather than trusting these
numbers once the file has changed since this commit.

### Implementation commits - `git log --oneline 0f2021e..e267d3d` (28)

Pinned at `e267d3d` so this table is deterministic and never disturbed by
later edits to this record:

### Close-out meta-commits (4, excluded from the implementation table)

These commits only create and maintain this close-out record; each lands after
`e267d3d` and therefore cannot appear in the pinned implementation range. This
is the self-reference stated above: a doc listing its own history cannot
include the commits that create and correct it.

- `aab0b07` - add close-out record with item citations, race lifecycle, and gate evidence (creates this file)
- `9054673` - finalize close-out commit range with this commit included
- `12f348e` - make close-out commit range self-consistent snapshot
- `e09550a` - reconcile close-out commit accounting - pinned implementation range + meta-commit list (this commit, which thus lands fourth)
- `e0de91c` - post-merge gate amendment - dev-merge verification evidence + isolation note (fifth meta-commit)
- `cd64f83` - ruff gate correction - `ruff check services/ libs/` clean after `f2c0ed8` (sixth meta-commit)
- `HEAD` - format-gate correction - `ruff format --check services/ libs/` clean after `29651a6` (seventh meta-commit)
