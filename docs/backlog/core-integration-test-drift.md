# Core - pre-existing integration-test drift (tech-debt log)

Logged during the SKY-70 semantic search gate (branch `feat/SKY-70-semantic-inventory-search`).
Scope decision (user-approved): **leave as tech-debt; do not fix under SKY-70.**

Status: **open**. Every failure below reproduces at the SKY-70 split base
(`08caa27` / `a12e1d7`) on a freshly recreated `skyrict_core_verify` database,
with zero SKY-70 involvement. Full suite: 815 passed, 11 failed; the 11th
(`test_team_size_gate_passes_for_four_members`, model-eval anomaly) is a
separate, already-followed pre-existing failure.

## Root cause A - stale `annual` accrual expectations (9 tests)

Commit `ff822f8` "feat(leave): replace annual with policy-driven casual+sick
(Leave Type Rework)" replaced the legacy `annual` accrual with
policy-driven `casual` + `sick` (`hr/service.py::_accrue_annual` and
`accrue()` handle only `casual`/`sick`; a people-resource with only
`annual` never materializes a balance). The integration tests below were
never updated, so they assert an `annual` balance that can never exist:

| `test_hr_api.py::TestLeaveLifecycle::test_approve_beyond_balance_is_rejected`                                       | expects `annual` balance to exist                  |

Fix direction (whenever resourced): switch these to `casual`/`sick` (or a
leave-type the tenant policy accrues), aligning with the rework's model and
its updated unit tests (`test_leave_service.py::test_list_accrual_leave_types_returns_only_accrual_types`
asserts `["casual", "sick"]`).

## Root cause B - sales fulfil needs a seeded COGS account (1 test)

| Test                                                               | Failure                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `sales/test_sales_api.py::TestFulfil::test_fulfil_creates_invoice` | `404 COGS account '5000' not found` |

Fulfilment creates an invoice whose COGS journal-entry references chart-of-accounts
code `5000`; no finance seed currently creates that account, so the request 404s.
Fix direction: add `5000` (Cost of Goods Sold) to the tenant finance
chart-of-accounts seed used by integration tests (or the fulfil test's own setup).
