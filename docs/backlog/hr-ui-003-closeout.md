# HR-UI-003 - Close-out

HR/Payroll workspace UI: §7.1/§7.2 sidebar scrollbar + chevron-pill styling, §7.3
HR/Payroll home overviews with click-through summaries, §7.4 dark-mode portal
containment, §8.1 employment-status transitions and compensation current-rate/history,
and §8.2 per-entry payroll adjustments. §7.5 (setup checklists) was explored and
**reverted** - explicit decision after seeing it rendered, plus it was rendering above
the KPI row (wrong position). This document records the deliverables, the locked
design decisions, the verification evidence, and the PR notes/caveats reviewers
should know.

Verification status: **all §7/§8 items delivered - rendered-UI gates 28/28 green**
(`gates.js`), plus per-phase checkpoints `checkpoint-6.js` 27/27 (read-only gating),
`checkpoint-81.js` 12/12 (status transitions), `checkpoint-82.js` 12/12 (adjustments).
Static gates (`tsc --noEmit`, `eslint .`, `next build`) green at HEAD; no new
repository dependencies. Live stack: identity + core in Docker, Next dev server on
`:3000`. Commit range `44963eb..HEAD` = 11 commits.

## §7.3 locked design decisions (as shipped)

- Overview sits on top of the module home; the existing list entry points remain
  below as "Explore" cards.
- HR KPIs - **Active employees / Open leave requests / On leave now /
  Departments**; Payroll KPIs - **Payroll runs / Draft runs / Paid runs /
  Latest run**.
- Status breakdown cards ("Leave requests by status", "Runs by status") and the
  recent-activity list render above their plain list pages, click-through via the
  breakdown row links to the corresponding filtered list view
  (`/erp/hr/leave?status=pending`, `/erp/payroll/runs?status=draft`).
- Counts are honest: `apiList` probes with `limit + 1` and `formatListCount`
  appends `+` whenever a following page exists (`lib/format.ts:81-86`) - a total
  is never guessed.
- Zero-data states render gracefully ("No records yet.", "No leave activity yet -
  hire a team member or create a leave request.").

## §8 locked design decisions (as shipped)

- **Compensation page (§8.1).** Shows the current rate line
  (`currently US$5,000.00/month`) and a History table; the current rate comes
  from `activeCompensation` on the employee list (backend enrichment, `6080d98`),
  not a separate fetch.
- **Adjustments (§8.2).** Every draft/computed run entry renders an **Adjust**
  button; the dialog amount is a **deduction** (net = gross − PF − tax − adj), a
  positive amount lowers net; entry rows are read-only once the run is approved
  (no Adjust affordance), with a "Read-only after approval" hint on computed runs.
  Computed runs remain adjustable (matching the backend, which blocks
  APPROVED/PAID only).

## PR notes / caveats

1. **Scope drift.** The ticket's §7.3 "home overview" expanded into a §7
   addendum covering §7.4 (portal containment in the module theme world,
   `0dbd14f`) and §7.1/§7.2 (sidebar scrollbar + chevron pill, `d334104`),
   plus a pre-§7 checkpoint commit (`44963eb`: BFF proxy routing, HR/Payroll
   API clients, sidebar permission gating, ERP page shells). Each boundary was
   kept in its own commit.

2. **Mock deletion divergence.** The ERP mock (`lib/mock/erp.ts`) was removed
   and the UI now talks to the live backend (`d364d83` = HR-BE-002 backend
   merge). Any behavior previously asserted against the mock will diverge from
   production responses (e.g. bare-array lists with no `meta`, snake_case
   payloads mapped to camelCase in `hr-api.ts`/`payroll-api.ts`).

3. **Synthesized totals.** The backend list endpoints return bare arrays, so
   `apiList` (`lib/api/http.ts:211-244`) synthesizes `PaginationMeta` from a
   `limit + 1` probe. `total`/`total_pages` are therefore "at least" values and
   `formatListCount` renders a trailing `+` when a following page exists. No
   invented exact counts anywhere.

4. **Core-RBAC provisioning gap (pre-existing, infra only).** The UI-check
   users were created with core role grants (`core_user_roles`) but **no
   identity role grants** (`user_roles`), which is what identity's
   `GET /roles/me` reads - so every ERP page rendered "No access to Business
   Operations". Additionally the olympus tenant had **no identity system roles
   at all**. Both were fixed at the data layer via `fix_rbac.py`
   (identity `user_roles` grants: `tenant_owner` → bridgeon check user,
   `organization_admin` → olympus check user, plus olympus system roles). This
   is environment/seed work, **not** part of the §7 commit range.

5. **§7.4 classification.** The portal-containment defect (Radix portals
   escaping the module theme-world wrapper and rendering against the global
   theme) was **pre-existing**, not introduced by §7.3 - the ERP page shells
   were the first Radix-in-theme-world surfaces. Fixed in `0dbd14f` within §7
   scope.

6. **Shared-primitive extraction.** `stat-card.tsx`, `status-breakdown.tsx`,
   and `recent-activity-list.tsx` were extracted under
   `components/dashboard/shared/` for the overviews. The Reports KPI cards and
   Finance modules reuse the same visual language and are flagged as adoption
   candidates (out of HR-UI-003 scope).

7. **Dev-server restart required.** RSC/layout changes require a clean Next dev
   server restart before verification; stale module state produced
   Client/Server-mismatch style failures during the gate runs.

8. **`next build` must not run while `next dev` is up.** Build and dev share
   `apps/web/.next`; a production build run against a live dev server corrupted
   the dev server's compile state and the signin surface began returning 500.
   Recovery = restart the dev server. Verification order for future phases: run
   static gates first, then restart dev, then run Playwright.

9. **`active_compensation` list enrichment (backend fix, `6080d98`).** The
   employee list previously returned a null compensation payload, so the §8.1
   compensation page had nothing to render a "current rate" from. Fixed in the
   core router (`services/core/.../routers/hr.py`) by populating
   `active_compensation` in the list serializer - the one code change outside
   `apps/web` in this range.

10. **Adjustment sign convention (§8.2).** Matches the backend: a stored
    adjustment `amount` is a **deduction** (`net = gross − pf − tax − adj`); the
    UI dialog labels it "Adjustment (deduction)" and `c6f6ba4` fixed the
    form-to-payload sign so a positive input lowers net. Do not "fix" the sign
    without re-reading HR-BE-002 semantics.

11. **VOID runs stay adjustable (backend gap, logged only).** The backend
    adjustment guard blocks APPROVED and PAID runs but **not VOID** - so a VOID
    run's entries are technically still mutable at the API level. The UI shows no
    Adjust affordance on void runs (treats void like approved/paid), so this is
    not user-visible; flagging for a future backend guard if voided runs must be
    immutable.

12. **Read-only verification user (data-layer only, not in source).**
    `ui.readonly@olympus.dev` (auditor) was provisioned directly in the identity
    and core databases (users row + `user_roles` identity grant + `core_user_roles`
    core grant) for `checkpoint-6.js`. Like the other UI-check users, it lives in
    the environment, **not** in repo seed data. Identity role → permissions
    mapping: `GET /roles/me` returns `erp.hr.read`/`erp.payroll.read` only; the
    UI hides every write affordance and the BFF returns 403 for POSTs.

13. **§7.5 checklist reverted.** The setup checklists (`7f75197`) were removed
    after seeing them rendered - the checklist rendered above the KPI row (wrong
    position, should have been below), and the section was not wanted at all.
    The underlying component (`setup-checklist.tsx`), its consumers
    (`hr-setup.tsx`, `payroll-setup.tsx`), and all gate-8/checkpoint-75 assertions
    were deleted. The `active_compensation` backend fix (`6080d98`) remains since
    it is useful independently. Dialog components (`department-dialog`,
    `compensation-dialog`, `run-dialog`) were not checklist-only - they are
    imported by the domain list pages and stay.

---

## Findings beyond scope (logged, not fixed here)

- **Browser-only session-loss race (dev/automation).** On the dev server, a
  full-page navigation started immediately after login can abort the previous
  page's in-flight `/api/auth/session` refresh: identity rotates the refresh
  token, but the browser never commits the `Set-Cookie`, so the next page
  presents the stale token and the identity **reuse detector revokes the whole
  token family** (`auth.refresh.reuse_detected`), landing the user back on
  signin with a cleared cookie. Real users click after the page settles, so this
  does not reproduce in manual use. The gate script mitigates it by waiting for
  the sidebar to render plus a 1.5s settle before any cross-page navigation.
  Worth a follow-up: a request-level single-flight that also covers aborted
  rotations.
- **`[role="alert"]` noise.** Next.js injects `#__next-route-announcer__`
  (an always-present live region) on every page; error-banner assertions must
  exclude it.
