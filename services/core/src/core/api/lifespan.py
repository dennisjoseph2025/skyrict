"""Application lifespan - startup verification and graceful shutdown.

Extracted from main.py for testability and separation of concerns.

Startup: configures structured logging and verifies every required dependency
ONCE (database, JWT public key) and refuses to boot on failure - the
orchestrator sees the non-zero exit and restarts the pod instead of serving
traffic with a dead dependency. The readiness gate only opens after
verification succeeds; ``GET /ready`` reports it (with lightweight live
probes) but never re-runs this verification.

Shutdown: closes the gate so probes drain the pod, then disposes the DB
engine.
