"""Revenue-forecast persistence (SKY-82 A4).

Reads the recognized-revenue series from approved invoices (the same source
boundary as finance: revenue is only recognized at ``approved``), and upserts
forecast rows keyed on ``UNIQUE (tenant_id, month)`` - the recompute guard.

Pipeline weighting reads the tenant's open CRM opportunities (same shared
database, tenant-scoped) - weighted conversion value per closing month is
``conversion_weight x amount`` of every non-terminal deal whose
``expected_close_date`` lands in the forecast horizon. The conversion weight
is deterministic CRM math (SKY-91): an explicit non-zero ``probability`` wins
(``probability/100``); otherwise the deal's stage contributes its historical
conversion rate - won / (won + lost) - derived from the tenant's
``erp_crm_timeline_events`` (``opportunity.won`` / ``opportunity.lost``
payload ``from_stage``); a stage without completed outcomes contributes
nothing. The weight is then modulated by the deal's latest health assessment:
``ai_deal_health`` is owned by the ai-agent service but lives in the same
shared database, so core reads it read-only (tenant-scoped by the same RLS
GUC) and blends its green/yellow/red band with the assessment's confidence
into the per-deal conversion weight. Deals the health engine has never
assessed keep their full weight. If the table is absent (e.g. an environment
where the ai-agent chain has not migrated yet), weighting degrades to the
unmodulated conversion-weight baseline.
