    {
        question: "Where does Skyrict GMIE get its data?",
        answer: "Signals are gathered across news, social, code, and trend sources, then cross-referenced so each finding lists its confidence and timeframe.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I scope research to a specific country or region?",
        answer: "Use the country selector in the top-right of the navbar. It persists for your session and the region is factored into searches and signals.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why do some results have low confidence?",
        answer: "Confidence reflects how many independent sources agree. Low-confidence items are still surfaced because early signals often matter most.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I export or save research?",
        answer: "Saving and exporting are coming soon. For now, each research pass can be re-run from Home, Explore, or Trending with a single click.",
