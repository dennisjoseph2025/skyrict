 * Authenticated BFF proxy for internal services' /api/v1/* endpoints.
 *
 * The browser talks to these same-origin handlers instead of the backend:
 * (a) the tenant slug is always derived server-side from the Host header (the
 * client's X-Tenant-Slug is ignored), (b) the client's Bearer access token is
 * forwarded when present - on the workspace origin it is absent on first load,
 * so the backend answers 401 and the client's single-flight silent refresh
 * (/api/auth/refresh, driven by the httpOnly session cookie) retries once,
 * and (c) state-changing methods must pass the Origin/Referer CSRF gate.
