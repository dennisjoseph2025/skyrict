 * The nearest module-world wrapper that re-tints the design tokens (theme-erp,
 * theme-agents, ...). Radix primitives portal to document.body by default,
 * which escapes that wrapper's CSS custom-property scope and makes dialogs,
 * selects, and popovers render with the base palette instead of the module's.
 * Mounting them here keeps every floating surface in the same theme as the
 * page behind it. Falls back to the nearest `[data-theme-scope]` wrapper (the
 * ERP shell sets one alongside its `theme-erp` class), then to document.body
 * when neither wrapper exists (workspace pages, or before the shell mounts)
 * so rendering never throws.
